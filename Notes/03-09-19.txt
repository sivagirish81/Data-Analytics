+ Correlation
	- Correlaton coefficient will always be in the range -1 to 1
	- Closer r is to +1 or -1 more related the variables are.
	- inverse correlation -ve r

+ Covariance
	- Change in one variable with respect to the other variable
	- Unscaled
	- correlation=covariance/Standard deviation'

+ Linear Regression
	- Residual : Difference between estimated and actual value.
	- Best-Fit : Residual sum of squares should be 0.

+ Model Output
	- R : Correlation Coefficient
	- R square - residual sum of squares
	- Adjusted R square
	- Dispersion around mean : Total sum of squares(TSS)
	- Residual Sum of Squares(RSS)
	- Reason for adjustment
	- While using multiple independent variables we have to adjust fir biases of the respective independent variables as well.
